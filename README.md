## The Problem 
Engagement in media is low due to bias and lack of diversity.   

6 corporations control 90% of the media in America. Our users tend to be college educated, aged 18-28, aren't receiving a diverse set of news, and receive most of their news through social media outlets. 

Use Cases:  Someone wants to know whom they are going to vote for in the primary, and wants to make sure they are receiving the correct information.  For example, if it is announced that a company funded Hillary Clinton’s campaign, it frames the perspective of the voter and provides some background information.

For example, CNN Announces that Hillary Clinton won the First Democratic debate but doesnt reveal that Time Warner is a donor to her campaign. This can potentially alter the way the viewer accepts the commentary provided, However other independent news teams may provide that information the user wouldn’t have otherwise known about and can perhaps put the discussion in a more objective context

## The Solution 
Frame aims to provide the user with a sense of what bias is coming out of the news so they can better adjust their frame or opinions and prevent internalizing implicit bias.

Baseline Features:
  *  Article Analysis via Machine Learning APIs to provide the user with the implicit bias of the articles that they read. Article chaining, which allows user to attach articles of the same topic to provide a wholistic view from different perspectives. User profiles that contain the user's reading bias.
  *  Bonus features: Users will be able to upload user-created news content
