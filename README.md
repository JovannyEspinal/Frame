## The Problem 
Media bias often misinforms consumers and influences their decisions in ways they could negatively impact them.

Use Cases:  CNN comments on Hillary Clintons performance in the first Democratic debate, but doesnt reveal that Time Warner is a donor to her campaign. The incentive could potentially influence how CNN chooses to color the event. Although the user, hasnt been informed of the app would tell them how them that CNN might have "framed" the article a certain way that might give them pause and look to other resources to make a more informed judgement of Clintons policies and appearance. 


## The Solution 
Frame aims to provide the user with a sense of what bias is coming out of the news so they can better adjust their frame or opinions and prevent internalizing implicit bias.
