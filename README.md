App Name: Frame

Team Members: Jovanny, Bereket, Lauren
Roles: Lauren - UI, Bereket & Jovanny - Backend & APIs
App Problem: News media engagement is at an all time low (especially amongst millenials) and is biased via language and selectivity

App Solution: Provide a platform for alternative independent journalism to thrive (addressing the selectivity problem) and show the users the difference in relative bias and trending ideas between mainstream and independent news.

MVP Features: (1) Feed of news from major news networks (2) Analyze those news articles to determine whether there is an existing bias

Post-MVP Features: Users can create profiles and upload user-created news content

Competitors: Major news networks, Youtube, etc.

Statistics: 6 corporations control 90% of the media in America

Use Cases:  Someone wants to know whom they are going to vote for in the primary, and wants to make sure they are receiving the correct information.  For example, if it is announced that a company funded Hillary Clinton’s campaign, it frames the perspective of the voter and provides some background information.

For example, CNN Announces that Hillary Clinton won the First Democratic debate but doesnt reveal that Time Warner is a donor to her campaign. This can potentially alter the way the viewer accepts the commentary provided, However other independent news teams may provide that information the user wouldn’t have otherwise known about and can perhaps put the discussion in a more objective context

User: People who want news that is not delivered through the filter of political or social bias
